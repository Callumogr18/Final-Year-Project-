# Final-Year-Project-
This project takes a look at traditional metrics for evaluating LLMs such as BLEU and ROUGE with the aim of proving why these traditional metrics do not meet the requirements given the robust demands placed on LLMs today. This project aims to create a standardised approach taking influence from efforts from up to date literature of the field.
